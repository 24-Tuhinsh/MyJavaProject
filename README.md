# MyJavaProject
A console-based Java SE application for managing academic records. This project demonstrates core OOP, modern Java APIs like Streams and NIO.2, custom exceptions, and design patterns. Key features include student and course management, GPA calculation, and data persistence via file I/O and backups.
Welcome to the Campus Course & Records Manager (CCRM) project! ðŸ‘‹
This is a simple, no-frills console application I built to manage student and course records. Think of it as a digital file cabinet for a school, where you can handle everything from student info to course enrollments and grades.

Getting Started
You'll need a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer to run this. If you don't have it, a quick search for "install JDK" will get you set up. I built this using Java 8, so make sure you have that version or newer. Once you have the JDK, just follow these simple steps:

Download the project: You can get a copy of the code by cloning this repository.

Open in your favorite IDE: Open the project in an IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ.

Run the Main class: Find the Main.java file and hit the "run" button. The application will start right up in your console!

What's Inside?
This project is more than just a simple program. I designed it to showcase some of the most important concepts in Java.

Organized and Tidy: The code is neatly organized into different packages to keep things easy to find and understand.

Built the "Right" Way: It's a great example of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), using ideas like encapsulation to protect data, inheritance to reuse code, and polymorphism to handle different object types smoothly.

Handling Problems: It uses custom exceptions to handle errors gracefully, so the program doesn't just crash when something goes wrong.

Modern Java: I've used some of the newer, more powerful features of Java, like the Stream API for processing data efficiently and the Date/Time API for managing timestamps.

File Handling: The app can read from and write to files, and it even has a built-in feature to create backups of your data.

Extra Info
This project was a way to explore some key Java topics, so you'll also find a few extra notes and explanations here:

Java's History: A quick look at how Java has changed over the years.

Java Versions: A simple comparison of Java ME (for small devices), Java SE (for general use like this app), and Java EE (for big enterprise systems).

JDK vs. JRE vs. JVM: A breakdown of the difference between the Java Development Kit, Runtime Environment, and Virtual Machine.
